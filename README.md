# methane

Here is a description of the modelling:

1. Aggregation of FAOSTAT production in 2010 from FAOSTAT

2. Loading of population, methane emissions production and price in 2010 from FAOSTAT

(3. Recalibration of production and emissions from SR1.5 based on FAOSTAT?)

4. Share of Irish production, population and methane emissions in 2010 compared to world values

5. Emission intensity per production and capita in 2010 compared to world values

6. World methane reduction in 2050 compared to 2010

7. Irish methane reduction in 2050 compared to 2010

End. How biased scenarios extracted from the SR1.5 are?
